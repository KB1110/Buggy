Buggy - Gesture Controlled Toy Car

Embarking on the frontier of interactive toys, I engineered a Bluetooth-controlled toy car equipped with intuitive hand gesture control functionality.

Engineered a cutting-edge Bluetooth-controlled toy car that responds to hand gestures, revolutionizing traditional remote control methods.

Leveraged two distinct control methods: Computer Vision and Accelerometer, offering users versatile and dynamic interaction with the toy car.

Implemented advanced hand gesture detection using MediaPipe from Google, harnessing the power of computer vision to interpret and translate hand movements into commands for the toy car.

Utilized the ADXL345 Accelerometer to precisely gauge the orientation of a hand and drive the car accordingly, providing an intuitive and hands-on control experience.

Employed the ESP32 Devkit Module to establish seamless Bluetooth communication between the controller (laptop or a glove on hand with accelerometer) and the toy car, ensuring swift and responsive command transmission.
